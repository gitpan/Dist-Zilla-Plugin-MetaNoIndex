NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaNoIndex - Stop CPAN from indexing stuff

VERSION
    version 1.101550

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini:

      [MetaNoIndex]
      directory = t/author
      directory = examples
      file = lib/Foo.pm
      package = My::Module
      namespace = My::Module

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin allows you to prevent PAUSE/CPAN from indexing files you
    don't want indexed. This is useful if you build test classes or example
    classes that are used for those purposes only, and are not part of the
    distribution. It does this by adding a "no_index" block to your META.yml
    file in your distribution.

ATTRIBUTES
  directory
    Exclude folders and everything in them. Example: "author.t". Aliases:
    "folder", "dir", "directories".

  file
    Exclude a specific file. Example: "lib/Foo.pm". Alias: "files".

  package
    Exclude by package name. Example: "My::Package". Aliases: "class",
    "module", "packages".

  namespace
    Exclude everything under a specific namespace. Example: "My::Package".
    Alias: "namespaces".

    NOTE: This will not exclude the package "My::Package", only everything
    under it like "My::Package::Foo".

METHODS
  metadata
    Returns a reference to a hash containing the distribution's no_index
    metadata.
